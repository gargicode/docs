I've created a comprehensive markdown document with the complete explanation! It includes:

- All 7 processing steps with detailed explanations
- A visual flowchart showing the entire process
- A "Key Concepts Explained" section that breaks down technical terms
- Emojis and formatting to make it easy to read

You can now save this markdown file and reference it anytime. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to add more details about any specific step!
