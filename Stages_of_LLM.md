["What", " is", " the", " capital", " of", " Canada"]
```
Think of tokens as puzzle pieces - they can be words, parts of words, or even punctuation. Each token gets converted to a number my neural network can understand.

## **Step 2: Embedding** 🎯
Each token is transformed into a vector - imagine a point in a massive multi-dimensional space (thousands of dimensions). Words with similar meanings cluster together in this space:
- "capital" might be near "city", "government", "nation"
- "Canada" might be near "country", "North America", "Ottawa"

## **Step 3: Attention Mechanism** 👀
This is where the magic happens. My network looks at ALL the tokens simultaneously and figures out which words are important to each other:

- "capital" pays attention to "Canada" (aha! looking for Canada's capital)
- "What" signals this is a question
- "is" connects the question structure
- The word "the" gets less attention (less meaningful here)

I'm essentially asking myself: "What relationships matter in this sentence?"

## **Step 4: Layer-by-Layer Processing** 🧠
My architecture has many layers (like a deep stack of pancakes). Each layer refines understanding:

**Early layers:** Recognize basic patterns
- "This is a question"
- "It's about geography"

**Middle layers:** Build concepts
- "Capital = main city of a country"
- "Canada = a specific nation"

**Deep layers:** Form complete understanding
- "User wants to know which city serves as Canada's seat of government"

## **Step 5: Context Integration** 📚
I access my training knowledge - billions of text examples I learned from. I've seen patterns like:
- "The capital of France is Paris"
- "Ottawa is Canada's capital city"
- "Canada's government is based in Ottawa"

My network activates these relevant memories.

## **Step 6: Response Generation** ✍️
Now I start predicting the best response, one token at a time:

1. First token: "The" (high probability to start this way)
2. Next token: " capital" (makes sense given the question)
3. Next: " of" (continuing the pattern)
4. Next: " Canada" (referring back to your question)
5. Next: " is" (connecting to the answer)
6. Next: " Ottawa" (the key information!)
7. Next: "." (ending the sentence)

At each step, I'm calculating probabilities: "What word should come next?" based on everything before it.

## **Step 7: Quality Checks** ✅
Throughout generation, I'm monitoring:
- Does this answer the question? ✓
- Is it factually correct? ✓
- Is it clear and helpful? ✓
- Should I add more detail?

## **Final Output** 🎉
```
The capital of Canada is Ottawa.
